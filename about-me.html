            <p>Hello! My name is Amber R. and I'm a full-stack web-developer. When I'm not coding I like to play 
                video games such as Fortnite and the Pokemon games, as well as watch tv shows like Yugioh 
                or Invincible. At home I often spend time with my cat, Tommy, while coding on my laptop. 
                
                When working I like to consider myself an artist, and the projects I work on to be my art. This 
                helps me stay on top of things and stay passionate even when getting error message after error 
                message, because I know it's all part of the process and that with all good art it takes time to 
                get it perfect.
            
                Some projects I have in the works include a browser game simulating the card game garbage, a 
                random character generator or two, a pokemon guessing game based on What's That Pokemon, and 
                more!
