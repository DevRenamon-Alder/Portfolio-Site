            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>Hello! My name is Amber R. and I'm a full-stack web-developer. When I'm not coding I like to play video games such</p>
            <p>as Fortnite and the Pokemon games, as well as watch tv shows like Yugioh or Invincible. At home I often spend time</p>
            <p>with my cat, Tommy, while coding on my laptop.</p>
            <p><span></span></p> 
            <p><strong>Me & My Work</strong></p>
            <p>When working I like to consider myself an artist, and the projects I work on to be my art. This helps me stay on</p> 
            <p>top of things and stay passionate even when getting error message after error message, because I know it's</p>
            <p>all part of the process and that with all good art it takes time to get it perfect.</p>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <p><strong>Future Projects</strong></p>
            <p>Some projects I have in the works include a browser game simulating the card game garbage, a random character</p>
            <p>generator or two, a pokemon guessing game based on What's That Pokemon, and more!</p>
