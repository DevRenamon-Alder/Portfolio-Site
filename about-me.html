            <p>Hello! My name is Amber R. and I'm a full-stack web-developer. When I'm not coding I like to play 
                video games such as Fortnite and the Pokemon games, as well as watch tv shows like Yugioh 
                or Invincible. I consider myself an artist, and the projects I work on in web development to 
                be my art. </p>
