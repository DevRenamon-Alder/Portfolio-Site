            <h2>Portfolio Created</h2>
            <p>I started making this portfolio on March 11th, 2025. As of now it has a home page, an about me 
                page, a contacts page, and a projects page. It has not yet been finished or released.

            <h2>About Me Page Finished</h2>
            <p>I started and finished the About Me page today, in which I included some fun facts about me, my 
                approach to coding, and some future projects I have planned.
            </p>

            <h2>Contacts Page Finished</h2>
            <p>I started and finished the Contacts page today, in which I included 3 links, one to my 
                LinkedIn, one to my GitHub, and one to my email, all using Font Awesome icons.

            <h2>Random Project Generator & Projects Page Finished</h2>
            <p>I started and finished a random project generator in the Projects page which randomly generates 
                a project and gives you its title, description, and link. While there is no more than one 
                project as of right now I do know that it works and have tested it. I also finished the 
                Projects Page and added the Random Girl Generator to it.
