            <p class="home">I started and finished a random project generator in the Projects page which randomly generates 
                a project and gives you its title, description, and link. While there is no more than one 
                project as of right now I do know that it works and have tested it. I also finished the 
                Projects Page and added the Random Girl Generator to it.

                LinkedIn, one to my GitHub, and one to my email, all using Font Awesome icons.
